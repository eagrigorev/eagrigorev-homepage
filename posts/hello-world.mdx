I guess I stayed silent for many months now, and it's better to do something
about it. My life changed multiple times since my last post on WordPress almost
two years ago. I left WordPress since then, switched my career and did dozens of
other things. For example, I started creating that website. Even though it's new
and unpolished, I have a place to express myself.

The ultimate idea of my website is still pretty vague. I would like to share
some life updates, illustrations, my fingerstyle guitar arrangements, some tech
stuff, probably. We'll see what comes of my idea.
