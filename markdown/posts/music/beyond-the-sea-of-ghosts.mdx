Five years passed since my first Boreal Heights release, Crystal Maze. For this
EP, I composed the song “Beyond the Sea of Ghosts” in two versions, acoustic and
metal. I published the metal version of the song and left the acoustic one in my
drafts for good. Now, I guess, it is time to make it public! Today I’m
presenting you my new single, called Beyond the Sea of Ghosts.

I’m still pretty okay with the genre I chose for my previous EP, so Beyond the
Sea of Ghosts is also dark folk-related. For this release, I used ambient sounds
for the first time. It seems that there is a vast field of experiments yet to
discover!

Though Beyond the Sea of Ghosts was generally reworked and rearranged, it is the
same old song. I changed several parts a little bit and made them playable on an
acoustic guitar. It is always hard to arrange songs meant to be metal for
various acoustic instruments. Sometimes it’s not worth it, but I’m sure that the
process went fine for that song!
