I decided to release the new Boreal Heights song as the second single of my
sure-to-come album. This song is called “Early Rains”. I hope you like it! I
also decided to modify my upcoming tracks slightly as I noticed that sometimes
it is a little bit tricky to play them, which dramatically affects the output
quality.
