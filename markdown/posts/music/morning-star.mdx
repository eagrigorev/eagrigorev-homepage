I’ve been composing new Boreal Heights songs for almost six months since the
beginning of 2015. It’s been quite a long period of silence since my last
release. Experiencing a painful departure, I caught a ray of inspiration and
wrote seven original songs, but in the end, I decided to record only two of
them. I didn’t feel that others are finished and ready for publishing. But those
two, “Morning Star” and “Back in February”, I felt like they are completed, and
there’s nothing to add.
