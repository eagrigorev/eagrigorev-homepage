I finally released the new Boreal Heights album, Winds & Windows. I’ve been
composing, recording and re-recording these songs for slightly more than a year.
Starting with acoustic guitars only, I later expanded instruments choice by bass
guitar, flute and piano. However, the first guitar-only singles are also
available here and there. Never following trends, I’ve always wanted to compose
music that I’d like to listen to myself. And I’m happy that other people also
find it interesting! If something in you resonates with Boreal Heights songs,
then all my efforts are not in vain.
