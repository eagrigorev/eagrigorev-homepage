I’m recording the new Boreal Heights album. Though the work is still in
progress, I decided to share with you the single from the upcoming release. It’s
called Far Lands. This song is not the first I recorded, by I decided to share
it as it has the authentic atmosphere and mood I’d want to express in the
upcoming album. I guess the final version of the “Far Lands” will be slightly
different, but I’m not sure yet, ’cause I like it the way it is.

The idea of Far Lands came to me while I composed the old “memories” post
several months ago on my blog and listened to Eventide by Eneferens. I started
to think that it could be a good idea to compose a spiritual brother for my
previously released Under Åpen Himmel and Beyond the Sea of Ghosts EP’s.

As for the rest of the album, the work is still in progress. At that moment, I
somehow managed to get over half of the tracks. I’m planning to release it
somewhere in Autumn.
