The time has come for the new Boreal Heights release. I’m proud to present to
you all something new this time, and I’m very excited about it! Under Åpen
Himmel is my new EP which I decided to record after another long silence. It’s
been a long year! Being somewhat tired from all the metal stuff I wrote
previously, I decided to try something new and composed two songs in the dark
folk genre.

It turned out to be a good idea as I feel completely drawn to this new genre I
opened recently via numerous YouTube videos. And you know what? It feels just
right. Like it is the thing I’ve always been searching for in my life.
