As a war galley sails through a storm, two dragons fight above the clouds,
ending in one's death. In the kingdom of Enlad, the royal wizard Root proclaims
the dragons to be a sign of a loss of balance in the world. The king is dealing
with disease sweeping across his kingdom, and the disappearance of his son,
Prince Arren. In the middle of the night, Arren kills his father, steals his
father's sword, and flees the castle.
