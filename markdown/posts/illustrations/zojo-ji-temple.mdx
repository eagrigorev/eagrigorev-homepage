I didn't draw since the last August, and this one was hard to begin. I'm glad
that I started doing pixel arts again. Kawase Hasui is one of my favourite
Japanese artists. All his woodblock prints are serene. I used
["Japanese Woodblock"](https://lospec.com/palette-list/japanese-woodblock)
palette by [Polyducks](https://polyducks.co.uk/).
