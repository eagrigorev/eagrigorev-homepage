Dark Souls is one of my favourite games, so I decided to draw something related
to that. I still remember how many times I died in the Undead Asylum location,
and what a relief it was to finally move out there in the claws of the Giant
Crow. ["Japanese Woodblock"](https://lospec.com/palette-list/japanese-woodblock)
