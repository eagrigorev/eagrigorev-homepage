It's been a long since I wrote anything on my website, but now it feels that I can't hold it anymore.
The world has changed, my life has changed as well. I left my country, my parents, my possessions and moved abroad.
I also left WordPress after 10 years of using since I wasn't able to control all the things and settings of my website.
So, I decided to move on to my own personal thing. This website is faster. I know how it works and what to improve.
Now it has zero design, but I will eventually update it. After all these months of traveling, my pilgrimage is somewhat over, at least for some time.

I have settled down with my wife in a pleasant town and as first-line necessary things have been sorted out, I could finally write.
I hope it will work well for me this time, but as always, there is only one way to know.
