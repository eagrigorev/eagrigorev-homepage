This year, I read 20 books and discovered seven new authors.

2015 was the year of Ulysses by James Joyce for me. I spent almost four months
reading it, fulfilling a desire I'd had for nearly ten years. Although I didn't
enjoy the book due to its extreme tediousness, I'm glad to have finally closed
that chapter. Another book was The Pope's Rhinoceros by Lawrence Norfolk, which
I also didn't enjoy. This book has its own story: I bought it five years ago and
never got around to reading it. It just sat on my bookshelf, forgotten. Now,
that chapter is also closed for good!
