I've decided to release a new Boreal Heights song as the second single from my
forthcoming album. This song is called "Early Rains," and I hope you enjoy it! I
also decided to make some slight modifications to my upcoming tracks, as I
noticed that they can be a bit tricky to play, which can significantly impact
the overall quality.

Recorded and mixed in August 2019. Engineered, mixed, and produced by Evgenii
Grigorev.
