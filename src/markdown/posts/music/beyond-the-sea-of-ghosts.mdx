Five years have passed since my first Boreal Heights release, Crystal Maze. For
this EP, I composed the song "Beyond the Sea of Ghosts" in two versions:
acoustic and metal. I originally published the metal version and left the
acoustic one in drafts, thinking it would stay there. But now, I believe it's
time to share it with the world! Today, I'm excited to present my new single,
"Beyond the Sea of Ghosts."

I'm still quite satisfied with the genre I explored in my previous EP, so Beyond
the Sea of Ghosts is also rooted in dark folk. For this release, I experimented
with ambient sounds for the first time, opening up a vast field of possibilities
for future exploration!

Although Beyond the Sea of Ghosts has been reworked and rearranged, it remains
the same song at its core. I made some adjustments to make it playable on
acoustic guitar. Arranging songs initially meant for metal on various acoustic
instruments is always challenging, and sometimes it's not worth the effort, but
I'm confident that this process worked well for this song!

Recorded and mixed from May to June 2018. Engineered, mixed, and produced by
Evgenii Grigorev.
