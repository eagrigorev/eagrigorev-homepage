I spent nearly six months at the start of 2015 composing new songs for Boreal
Heights. It had been quite a long period of silence since my last release. After
experiencing a painful departure, I found a spark of inspiration and wrote seven
original songs. However, in the end, I decided to record only two of them. The
others didn't feel finished or ready for release. But with "Morning Star" and
"Back in February," I felt they were complete, with nothing more to add.

Recorded and mixed from February to July 2015. Engineered, mixed, and produced
by Evgenii Grigorev.
