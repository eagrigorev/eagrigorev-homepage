Boreal Heights is a musical project I started in 2013. I experiment with
different genres and styles, drawing inspiration from nature. The project is
currently on hold due to limited free time and a lack of equipment after leaving
Russia.

I'm excited to announce the release of the new Boreal Heights album, _Winds &
Windows._ I spent just over a year composing, recording, and re-recording these
songs. The project began with acoustic guitars only, but I later expanded the
instrumentation to include bass guitar, flute, and piano. However, the original
guitar-only singles are still available in various places. I've never been one
to follow trends; I've always wanted to create music that I personally enjoy
listening to, and I'm thrilled that others find it interesting as well! If
Boreal Heights songs resonate with you, then all my efforts have been
worthwhile.

Recorded and mixed from April 2019 to May 2020. Engineered, mixed, and produced
by Evgenii Grigorev.
