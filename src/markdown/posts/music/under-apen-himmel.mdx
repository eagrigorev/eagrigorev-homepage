The time has come for a new Boreal Heights release, and I'm proud to present
something different this time. I'm very excited to share _Under Åpen Himmel,_ my
new EP, which I decided to record after another long period of silence. It's
been quite a year! Feeling somewhat fatigued from the metal music I previously
composed, I decided to explore something new and wrote two songs in the dark
folk genre.

This turned out to be a great decision, as I've found myself completely drawn to
this new genre, which I recently discovered through various YouTube videos. And
you know what? It feels just right — like something I've been searching for all
my life.

Recorded and mixed from July to September 2016. Engineered, mixed, and produced
by Evgenii Grigorev.
