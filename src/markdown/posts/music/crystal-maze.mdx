I had a strong desire to finally create something original, to express my
feelings and thoughts, and to test my new guitar. This is how Crystal Maze came
to life. Heavily influenced by Katatonia, Opeth, and other doom metal bands, I
recorded these two metal tracks. I hope you enjoy them.

Recorded and mixed from September to November 2013. Engineered, mixed, and
produced by Evgenii Grigorev.
