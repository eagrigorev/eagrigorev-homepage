I had a strong desire to finally create something original, to express my
feelings and thoughts, and to test my new guitar. This is how _Crystal Maze_
came to life. Heavily influenced by Katatonia, Opeth, and other doom metal
bands, I recorded these two metal tracks. I hope you enjoy them.

Recorded and mixed from September to November 2013. Engineered, mixed, and
produced by Evgenii Grigorev.
