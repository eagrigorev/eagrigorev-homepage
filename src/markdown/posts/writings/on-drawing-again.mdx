  'Sometimes, giving a second try to an old hobby is not a bad thing at all.'

Two months ago, while we were looking after a friend's cat in their apartment
during their vacation in Canada, I found myself with absolutely nothing to do. I
had grown tired of coding and reading simultaneously and couldn't find anything
to occupy myself during those days. A couple of months before that, my wife had
gifted me a new notebook and a set of pencils for my birthday. I decided to give
it a go and started drawing pen and ink sketches again, almost the same way I
did back in 2012 and then again in 2015.

I've been drawing on and off for a decade and still haven't settled into the
habit. This is my third attempt, and I hope that this time it goes well. I
really enjoy drawing. The meditative practice of filling in shapes clears my
head, and sometimes I regret not starting to draw consistently many years ago.
So much wasted time, so much wasted potential. I just hope that it will work out
someday, and until then, I will practice. I'll keep this post updated with my
sketches to track progress and motivate myself not to give up.
