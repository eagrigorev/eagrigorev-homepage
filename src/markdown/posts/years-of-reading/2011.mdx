This year I read 15 books and discovered eight new authors.

I'm not happy with my reading list this year, to be honest. I managed to finish
a super low amount of books, though there were the hard ones like Sometimes a
Great Notion, for example. Anyways, three months for a book is an unacceptably
high amount of time! The other book I read for too long was Dubliners by James
Joyce, which I thoroughly disliked. Following the rule of not abandoning boring
books, I became a prisoner of my own beliefs and stuff. You know, the situation.
