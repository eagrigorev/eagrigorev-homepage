This year I read 34 books and discovered nine new authors.

During this year, I reread a lot. I utilised reading books in English and
discovered several new authors and out-of-print books by my favourite writers
from the past, thanks to my e-reader! I picked Watership Down by Richard Adams
as I've never read such positive and feels-like-home books with a highly
developed world and solid background. Also, I love rabbits!
