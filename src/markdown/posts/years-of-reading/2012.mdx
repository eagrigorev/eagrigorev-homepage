This year I read 141 books and discovered 25 new authors.

This year was a mess! I've been sick a lot. I read every day for like six to
eight hours, swallowing books one after another. I reread a lot of stuff also:
Макс Фрай, Haruki Murakami and so on. I've discovered several new authors too,
but it wasn't my goal. Facing numerous obstacles during this year's course, I
wanted to read my all-time favourite stuff and recall it in my memory as much as
possible.
