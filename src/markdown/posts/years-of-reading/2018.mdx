This year I read 33 books and discovered 17 new authors.

Ayn Rand's Atlas Shrugged was the year's book without further arguing. I divided
this book into three parts and read it for three months. I still think about
this book because it changed something in me. Though I'm not a fan of Ayn Rand's
philosophy, I found her work somewhat close to my way of thinking.

I finally realised that audiobooks are unsuitable because I can't concentrate on
listening.
