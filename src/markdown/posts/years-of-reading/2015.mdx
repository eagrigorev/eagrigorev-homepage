This year I read 20 books and discovered seven new authors.

2015 was the year of Ulysses by James Joyce. I read it for almost four months
and tended to my desire to read this book for nearly ten years. Though I didn't
enjoy this book due to its extreme boringness, I finally closed that gestalt.
The other one was The Pope's Rhinoceros by Lawrence Norfolk I also didn't enjoy.
This book has its history. I bought it five years ago and didn't read it since
then: I just put it on my bookshelf and forgot about it. Now this gestalt is
also closed for good!
