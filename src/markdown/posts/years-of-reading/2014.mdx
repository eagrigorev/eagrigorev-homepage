This year I read 23 books and discovered 14 new authors.

I might say that 2014 was the year of non-fiction literature. At the same time,
I found another great author, whom I loved at first sight. I guess Isle of
Dreams by Keizo Hino became my all-time favourite. I also finished The Magic
Mountain by Thomas Mann: the book I have wanted to read since I started working
at our local book store in 2009.
