This year I read 21 books and discovered seven new authors.

I finally managed to read the book The Past is a Foreign Country by David
Lowenthal, which I wanted to read for at least five years — laying in my bed,
reading, remembering various stuff and emotions from my past life. I guess I got
something fixed in my brain because it has become easier to think about certain
parts of my life. Also, I'm entirely happy with the new series by Макс Фрай,
which unfurls before my eyes.
