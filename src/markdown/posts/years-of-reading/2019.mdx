This year I read 66 books and discovered 19 new authors.

This year I finally finished almost every book by Yukio Mishima, whom I have
wanted to read for a long time. Also, in 2019 I set the rule to discover at
least one or two new authors every month and already found decent ones for my
collection! The most significant discovery of this year was, without any doubt,
Jonathan Coe. I have wanted to read his books since my job in our local book
store almost ten years ago.
