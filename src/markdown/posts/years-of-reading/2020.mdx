This year I read 27 books and discovered 14 new authors.

I tried to discover as many new authors as possible and was happy with almost
everyone. Self-isolation encouraged me to read primarily digital books, so I
continue to use my e-reader. I hardly can remember if I visited our local book
store even once!
