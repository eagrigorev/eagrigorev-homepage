This year I read 39 books and discovered ten new authors.

It was a kind of calm year. I changed my job and started working hard, setting
some anchors on the new place. I read without any system: I reread Haruki
Murakami, took some relatively new stuff from F. Scott Fitzgerald that was never
released earlier and two big books by Ernst Jünger. Something like that, I
guess.
