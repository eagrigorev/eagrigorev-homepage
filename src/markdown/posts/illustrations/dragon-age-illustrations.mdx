The Dragon Age game series, developed by BioWare, is a critically acclaimed
fantasy RPG franchise set in the world of Thedas. It debuted in 2009 with
_Dragon Age: Origins_, which introduced players to a rich narrative full of
complex characters, moral choices, and epic battles. The series is known for its
deep lore, tactical combat, and the ability to shape the story through player
decisions. Subsequent titles, such as _Dragon Age II_ and _Dragon Age:
Inquisition_, expanded on the world and introduced new gameplay elements, with
Inquisition earning particular praise for its open-world exploration and
storytelling. The series is highly regarded for its compelling blend of high
fantasy, character-driven stories, and intricate world-building.
