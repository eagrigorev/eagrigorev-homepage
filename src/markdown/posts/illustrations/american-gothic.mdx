"American Gothic" is an iconic painting by Grant Wood, completed in 1930. It
depicts a stern-faced farmer and his daughter standing in front of their
Carpenter Gothic-style home in rural Iowa. The painting's realistic style and
the figures' somber expressions have made it a cultural icon, often parodied and
referenced in popular culture. While Wood intended to portray a positive image
of rural life, the painting's ambiguity has led to various interpretations,
including satire of Midwestern values and a commentary on social class and
gender roles.
