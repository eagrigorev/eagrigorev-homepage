Japanese woodblock printing, known as ukiyo-e, emerged during the Edo period
(1603-1868) and became a popular art form depicting scenes of everyday life,
landscapes, and famous actors.

The process involves carving an image into a wood block, inking the block, and
then pressing it onto paper, often requiring multiple blocks for different
colors. Ukiyo-e artists like Hokusai and Hiroshige are famous for their
intricate and vivid prints, such as "The Great Wave off Kanagawa."

This art form was not only a visual delight but also an affordable way for
common people to own art. Over time, ukiyo-e influenced Western artists,
contributing to the Japonisme movement in Europe. Today, Japanese woodblock
prints are celebrated as both historical and artistic treasures, embodying the
cultural and aesthetic values of their time.
