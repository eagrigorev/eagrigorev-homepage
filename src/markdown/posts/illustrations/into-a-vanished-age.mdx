I was deeply impressed by the illustrations of
[Teagan White](https://www.teaganwhite.com/) and
[Lily Seika Jones](https://www.lilyseikajones.com/), which inspired me to create
a series of pixel art featuring various critters and animals. Sometimes, I feel
like I could write an entire story about these tiny adventurers, and perhaps one
day, I will.
