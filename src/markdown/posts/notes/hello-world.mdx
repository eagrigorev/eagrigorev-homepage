Hello, everyone! After months of refining, redesigning, writing, and rewriting
code, I feel like I'm finally ready to launch my blog for the first time in
years. The last time I blogged was around 2018, if my memory serves me well. So
many things have happened since then: an invasion, immigration, a career path
change, marriage, and new hobbies. But it still feels like the growing hole in
me that appeared after I stopped writing was never filled. So, I unsheathe my
digital sword again, ready to cut through words.

This blog is called "A Space for the Unbound," named after a
[video game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Space_for_the_Unbound) I
particularly like because it resonates with how I feel â€” unbound. After leaving
Russia, many ties were cut, and almost nothing holds me back anymore. My bond
with the place where I was born grows thinner every day, and relationships decay
and crumble. There is almost no way back for me.

I will blog mostly about my hobbies, the past, and my job. Additionally, I will
try to follow the concept of
[digital gardening](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history?ref=ideasurg.pub)
for this blog. Each post will have a publish date and an edit date, and I will
return to previous posts often, refining them until I'm satisfied. I hope this
space will help me find myself and figure out how to live this life after it was
upended.
