I was born in the Soviet Union in 1987 and lived in Saint Petersburg for the
whole life. In 2022 I moved to Turkey, and later to Latvia and then to Greece,
where I'm currently living. Having almost 12 years of engineering experience, I
was never satisfied with what I'm doing and for what purpose, so I studied
programming and switched my career.

In my free time, I prefer to hike in the hills, play guitar and compose music,
and draw illustrations. I also read a lot. I love minimalism and clean
interfaces, well-documented code and lists, micro-management of social networks,
and calisthenics, Japanese literature and lifetime learning paradigm.
