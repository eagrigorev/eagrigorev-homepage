## 2024

### August

After two months of studying driving theory, I finally started taking lessons.
The idea of driving has always made me anxious—and still does—but after a few
lessons, I'm already feeling more comfortable. It even seems like I might soon
be ready to embark on my first adventure!

### May

I began learning driving theory. After years of hesitation, I feel that I'm
finally ready to become more mobile and less reliant on buses. Depending on
public transportation has been a pretty exhausting experience.

### January

I resumed working on my website. I decided to rewrite everything from scratch
and implement a new design. It took me quite a while to come up with something,
but at least the process has started. I'm also continuing my weekly calisthenics
training that I began at the end of November. My body hurts almost constantly,
but I enjoy the workouts.

I've been reading Haruki Murakami and Banana Yoshimoto. Last year, I started
re-reading everything I could get my hands on, and I plan to continue doing that
this year.
