Now pages are somewhere in between Twitter feeds and about pages. Something you
would tell your friend after a long time no see.

## January 2024

Started working on my website again. I decided to rewrite everything from
scratch and implement a new design. It took me quite a long to come up with
something, but at least the process has started. I'm also continuing visiting my
weekly calisthenics trainings that I started at the end of November. My body
hurts almost constantly, but I enjoy workouts.

Reading Haruki Murakami and Banana Yoshimoto. The last year I started re-reading
everything I could lay my hand on, and this year I'm going to continue doing
that.
