Recorded & mixed in September — November 2013.

I had a strong desire to finally write something original, express my feelings
and thoughts, and test my new guitar: this is how Crystal Maze came to life.
Being strongly influenced by Katatonia, Opeth and other doom metal bands, I
recorded these two metal songs. I hope you like them.
