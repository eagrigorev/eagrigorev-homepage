On that, page you can find all the arrangements that I wrote in 2014 — 2022.
Most of these arrangements you could see on my YouTube channel in the past years
or buy in the Gumroad shop that is now closed. From now on, all these tabs are
free forever and you can download them and modify to your liking, use them in
your studies or reproduce. Most of these arrangements are not well adapted and
look pretty raw. I have no intentions on updating them, maybe with a few
exceptions only. You can reach me out if you have any specific request and want
me to adapt something for you.

Updated arrangements are getting moved from that archive to the
[new tabs](/new-tabs) page.
