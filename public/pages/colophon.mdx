I designed this website in Figma and built it myself. Everything is posted on my
[GitHub](https://github.com/eagrigorev/eagrigorev-website), so feel free to fork
it and build your own.

## Tech

I wrote all the interfaces using JavaScript and React components, and styled
them with SCSS modules. Fonts are Roboto and Roboto Condensed, and the color
scheme is from the bottom of Pinterest boards. The backend part is served by
NodeJS. The application is deployed on Vercel. All my posts and pages are just a
bunch of MDX files. MDX is Markdown on steroids with the possibility to enchance
your writing experience with JavaScript logic and custom React components. The
typical process of publishing consists of three steps: first, you need to write
a post, then push it to GitHub, and finally merge it into the master branch.
Vercel does all the deployment magic automatically.
